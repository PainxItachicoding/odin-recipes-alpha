    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
            Add onion and 2 cloves garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place beef in a large bowl. Add onion-garlic mixture, parsley, egg, bread crumbs,
            and 1 large handful of fontina cheese, reserving the rest for topping. Season with
            salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix by hand until just combined.
            Scoop meat mixture into 24 mini muffin cups; meatballs need not be
            perfectly round.</li><li> Bake in the oven until no longer pink in the centers,
            about 12 minutes. Leave oven on. Let meatballs cool briefly while you make the garlic butter.
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining minced garlic once butter starts
            to bubble;stir, then immediately remove from heat. Stir well and set aside.</li>
        <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil; coat foil with remaining olive oil.
            Transfer rolls, still attached, to the baking sheet. Cut a hole in the top of each roll, about
            2/3 rolls of the way down. Brush garlic butter over the insides and outsides of the rolls.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Pour about 1 tablespoon tomato sauce into each hole.
            Stuff meatballs into the holes. Top each roll with a spoonful of tomato sauce and remaining fontina
            cheese. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Continue baking until cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes. Garnish with more parsley.
            Let rolls sit for 5 to 10 minutes to firm up; transfer to a serving platter.</li>
        </ol>
